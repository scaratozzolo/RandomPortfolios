# RandomPortfolios
For QF102 Presentation


Analyzing monkey portfolios and why they tend to beat or average the market

Generates graphs for SPY ETF for given years, graphs for overall returns, csv files for returns, csv files for closing prices of all stocks in a portfolio, heatmaps for correlation between stocks in a portfolio and between returns and the SPY ETF

Code isn't very clean and it's not meant to be, all files don't necessarily work together, but together separately, if that makes sense.
Different ways to load data and to load tickers exists in all the files.
